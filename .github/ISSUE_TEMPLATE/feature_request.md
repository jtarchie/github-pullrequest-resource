** Is your feature request to extend the resource with a Github API call? **
Please clarify why this is beneficial and necessary for the resource. Most Github API calls can be performed with [`hub`](https://github.com/github/hub) or `curl` command from a `task`. The resource should not be a complete wrapper of the Github API.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
