# How to contribute to the pullrequest resource

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jtarchie/pullrequest-resource/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jtarchie/pullrequest-resource/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Write a test for your feature. Run all the tests! This will give you and us a higher confidence that nothing broke.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Please open a [open a new issue](https://github.com/jtarchie/pullrequest-resource/issues/new) describing the feature you'd like to add.

## **Requirements for a Pull Request

A pull request won't be reviewed without the following:

* Updated docs
* Test coverage of the added feature
* Clear explaination of the intention of the pull request.

Thanks!
